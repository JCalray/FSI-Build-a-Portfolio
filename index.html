    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Joshua Viray. I am a student in CSULB's Coding Bootcamp looking to expand my skillset in tech.
      What got me interested in coding was visiting the TeamLabs Planets exhibit in Tokyo, Japan. I want to create beautiful
      and intricate digital art like what I experienced in that exhibit. Much of what I consume influences my creations.
      This includes nature, animation, virtual and augmented reality, hip hop music, japanese culture, bikes...The list goes on. 
      My goal is to create art that inspires others to create also.
