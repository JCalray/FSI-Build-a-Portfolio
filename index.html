    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Joshua Viray. I am a student in CSULB's Coding Bootcamp looking to expand my skillset in tech.
      What got me interested in coding was visiting the TeamLabs Planets exhibit in Tokyo, Japan. I want to create beautiful
      and intricate digital art like what I experienced in that exhibit. Much of what I consume influences my creations.
      This includes nature, animation, virtual and augmented reality, hip hop music, japanese culture, bikes. The list goes on. 
      My goal is to create art that also inspires others to create also.

    <h3>My Future Projects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Projecting 3D models onto live-action video using using motion capture.</li>
      <li>Using facial tracking to convert translate to 3d animation, focusing on mouth flaps</li>
      <li>Augmented reality of a 3D model with multiple people seeing the same render</li>
    </ul>

      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded
